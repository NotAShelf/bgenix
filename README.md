# bgenix

A Go implementation of Agenix.

## Goals & Non-goals

In the order that they are given.

### Goals

- Works on _my_ machine
- Not bash
- Relatively fast
- Structured and readable code

### Non-goals

- Works on _your_ machine
- Rage support
- Anything I don't care about

## TODO

- Better configuration management
- Properly implement `-r`/`--rekey`
- Try using Age as a Go library instead of the Age binary
- Flake-parts support (?)
  - See agenix-rekey
